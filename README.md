# MIPS Assembly projects
These were originally created for a college course. These are uploaded in the state that they were turned in as, any bugs are detailed in this README.

## How to use
Run these programs in a MIPS emulator. I used QtSPIM as that was the simulator used in the class.

## Project 1: Hamming Encoding/Decoding
This is a simple program for encoding and decoding numbers using Hamming codes to detect and correct single bit flips (or to detect two bit flips, but cannot correct them).

### Known Bugs
The program registers do not re-initialize correctly after running a decode for the first time. Resetting the program fixes the issue.

## Project 2: Roguelike
